## Overview

The attack is implemented in the file `deanonymize.py` to infer sensitive information from the queries stored in the file `queries.csv` which were issued by the users of the app. The details of the functions used in that file can be found in the corresponding section in the report. A defense mechanism is implemented in the Jupyter notebook `defense.ipynb`. Again, the details of the defense mechanism can be found in the corresponding section in the report. As helper functions, we defined new functions in the file `grid.py` to process the cell grids in the map more conveniently.
